You are the primary agent. Work spec-first.

Goal: Engaged MVP rewrite focusing on:
- Auth C: Supabase Email/Password with email confirmation required + Google OAuth
- Basic calendar UI
- Event CRUD
- Public share links that show title/time/location but hide notes

Phase 0:
- Confirm app runs locally (already: npm run dev)
- Document MVP scope in MVP_PLAN.md (avoid scope creep)

Phase 1 — Trim to core routes/pages:
Keep only:
- /auth/signin
- /auth/signup
- /auth/reset-password
- /calendar (main logged-in page)
- /e/[shareSlug] (public view)

Disable/remove from nav and routes:
- ai-match
- discover
- onboarding (optional)
- organizer
- admin
- scraping UI

Phase 2 — Auth C implementation:
Reuse existing auth scaffolding (AuthProvider, hooks, Supabase SSR client patterns):
- Email/Password signup (email confirmation required before login)
- Sign in/out
- Reset password (email → recovery link)
- Update password via Supabase recovery flow
- Google OAuth: "Continue with Google" button on sign-in page
- Document Supabase console settings + redirect URLs for local + prod

Phase 3 — Calendar + events CRUD:
- Calendar UI using react-big-calendar
- Events stored in Supabase table events
- CRUD: create/update/delete/list per logged-in user
- Fields: title, start/end, location, notes

Phase 4 — Public sharing:
- Add share_slug to each event (random)
- Public page /e/[shareSlug]
- Public view shows title/start/end/general location label; notes hidden

Constraints:
- Windows dev environment; avoid bash-specific scripts.
- Keep changes small/coherent.

Output:
- After each phase: summarize changes + next steps.
- When finished: print a short summary and stop.
